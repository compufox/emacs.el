* Custom

When I first started getting into Emacs, I obviously tried to use the built-in =customize= screens to build and setup my configuration.

Between other configuration's I saw online and trying to provide my own functionality I quickly moved past using it in favor of configuring packages directly. This became even more trivial once I stumbled across =use-package= (see [[file:7-packages.org][7-packages.org]] for examples on usage).

** TODO
*** Move all custom settings from here into [[file:6-misc.org][6-misc.org]]

** Variables

   ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.

** Faces

Cartograph CF is such a beautiful font, I highly recommend you go check it out. The folks did a wonderful job creating it.
