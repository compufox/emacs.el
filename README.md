# :writing_hand:â€‹ðŸ¦Š focksy emacs

## Installing 

1. clone the repo
2. run the setup script from the installer directory for your OS
3. start emacs

The setup scripts will backup your current emacs config and emacs.d directory (to `~/.emacs.bak` and `~/.emacs.d.bak`) before symlinking emacs.el to `~/.emacs`. It will then attempt to install any fonts inside the `fonts/` directory and refresh the font cache.

## NOTES
- If you are running on macOS, the editor will respond to system theme changes.
This transition between light/dark mode themes is made smoother by using [emacs-plus](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus).
If you are using a different version of emacs that does not have the appropriate patches applied, it will default to using a method involving making shell calls to the included applescript "CheckSystemTheme.scpt" file.
This will cause a "System Events" dialog popup asking for permission to continue.
- The fonts directory as provided is empty and the config itself specifies non-free fonts, so please make changes as-needed for your setup.
- The extras directory contains supporting files, such as the `CheckSystemTheme.scpt` applescript as well as unit files for launching emacs as a daemon.
